# Security Policy
## Suported Versions
Only latest on stable, since this is rolling release, is supported. Any custom forks or custom (nightly) builds are not supported...

## Reporting a Vulnerability
...However, if a vulnerability is found in a stable build and the error is from something unchanged, then please immediately report it.  
I don't expect anything like remote code execution, but I do expect stability issues like panics or anything like that.
